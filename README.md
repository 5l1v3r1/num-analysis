 * [kahan](kahan/) - a simple algorithm for summing up numbers without error.
 * [ludecomp](ludecomp/) - decompose a matrix A into PAQ=LU, then use the factorized form to solve Ax=b.
 * [unitcircles](unitcircles/) - a simple HTML app to visualize different p-norms.
 * [regression](regression/) - basic regression using least squares.
